ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON 3D PRINT, ENCLOSURE & ASSEMBLY


Tips on the Enclosure:

+ Our 3D model was made with the intention of 3D printing then flocking to add texture to the print.

+ It’s a 2 part print that snap-fits together in order to secure the 3D print to the fabric.

+ The front of the heart has a step for attaching velcro. The velcro attaches to the jacket to align the acrylic heart with the felt heart. The file for laser cutting the velcro can be found in the laser cut parts file.

+ We also designed and 3D printed a part to hold our on/off button and USB charging port. The dimensions of this part reflect the switch and USB cable that we used. If you use different components, be sure to modify the size of the openings.


Tips on the Acrylic:

+ We made the center of the hearts out of diffusion acrylic that we hand dyed in hot water using synthetic dye. You can achieve a similar result by using colored gels and diffuser films.

+ When gluing the acrylic to the print, take care not to use a cyanoacrylate super glue. CA glues have a tendency to off-gas and damage acrylic.


Tips on Assembly:

+ While the bear is still stuffed, mark the placement of the heart. At this point, carefully remove the stuffing from the chest of the bear.

+ We used an x-acto to cut an ‘x’ in the fabric in the center of where the heart will be attached. Using the slits you just made, carefully put the first half of the heart (smaller half) into the fabric.

+ At this point, flip the bear over to complete assembly from the inside.

+ Install the adhesive-backed LEDs behind the diffusion acrylic. Once installed, we hot glued on a piece of white acrylic to serve as a light bounce and to protect the LEDs from the stuffing. This file can be found in the laser cut parts file.

+ Carefully secure the PCB to the second half of the heart (larger heart). The board should sit beneath the mounting bosses. The battery sits directly above the board.

+ Push the two halves of the heart together until the snap-fit engages. In order for this to be as strong as possible, the slits of the fabric need to be captured within the snap fit.

+ Before adding the final piece of acrylic, make sure you test that the foam sensor, LEDs, and IR LEDs are all working. 

+ Once you’re feeling good about everything, screw in the final piece of acrylic, the back. We left this piece removable to ensure easy access for code pushes and troubleshooting.

+ At this point you can carefully re-stuff your bear. Because of the mass that we added with the prints, We used about 90% of the filling that we removed. Try and position the wires and foam towards the center of the bear.
